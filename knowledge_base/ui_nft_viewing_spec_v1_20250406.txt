Task 1: UI/UX Designer - Refined NFT Viewing Interface
Agent: UI/UX Designer (Mobile Web)

Output:

Updated Wireframes and Design Document for NFT Viewing Interface (Player Inventory/Collection Screen):

1. Overview:
The NFT viewing screen allows players to clearly view their NFT collection, quickly identify rarity, see detailed ownership and transaction history, and scale gracefully with varying collection sizes.

2. Rarity Visualization:
NFTs are color-coded and have distinct visual styles, making rarity immediately recognizable:

Common: gray border, simple background

Uncommon: green border, subtle glow animation

Rare: blue border, particle effect background

Epic: purple border, dynamic animated frame

Legendary: golden border, bright animated glow with subtle particle effects

Additionally, clearly labeled rarity badges (text + icon) appear prominently in the top-right corner of NFT cards, ensuring color accessibility.

3. Transparency Indicators (Ownership and Transaction History):
When selecting an NFT, an expanded detail pane appears:

Ownership History: Listed chronologically, including previous owners' usernames (with clickable profiles), timestamps of transfers, and transaction platforms used.

Transaction Details: Transparent transaction logs with clear timestamps, block explorer links (if blockchain-based), and transaction IDs (shortened with hover-to-expand functionality).

Minting Information: Shows mint date, total minted NFTs in the tier, and remaining mint amount if applicable (e.g., Legendary 2/20 minted).

4. Scalability Considerations:

Infinite scrolling with lazy loading is implemented for optimal performance with large collections.

Grid-based layout, adaptive to screen size, allowing 2-3 NFTs per row on smaller screens and 4-5 per row on larger screens.

Filter and sorting options prominently placed at the top of the screen for easy navigation (Filter by rarity, recent transactions, date minted, alphabetical order, etc.).

5. Wireframes (Text-Based Representation):
