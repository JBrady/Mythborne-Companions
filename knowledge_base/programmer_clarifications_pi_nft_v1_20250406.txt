Task 2: Lead Programmer - NFT Event Backend Logic Implementation
Agent: Lead Software Engineer (Mobile Web Games - HTML5/JS)

Output:

The backend logic implemented for the first NFT event in Mythborne Companions consists of several modular components and clear interfaces to the placeholder NFT minting handler scaffold. The detailed breakdown is as follows:

1. Quest Tracking Module:

A dedicated QuestTracker module has been implemented to monitor player progress within the NFT event quests. This module maintains a stateful representation of player quest progress, storing task completion statuses, timestamps, and related metadata.

The module interfaces with existing player profile management to track event quest states persistently, ensuring accurate retrieval and updates across sessions.

Quest progress updates are triggered by game events (e.g., battle completions, item collections), communicated via a centralized event dispatcher system, ensuring decoupled and maintainable logic.

2. Quest Completion Check Logic:

A QuestCompletionChecker function handles the evaluation of quest completion criteria. It accesses the QuestTracker states and evaluates predefined conditions specified by the game designer (such as number of battles won, resources gathered, or specific achievements).

Upon meeting completion criteria, the checker marks the quest state as "completed," triggering subsequent reward calculation and distribution processes.

This functionality includes robust validation mechanisms to prevent incorrect state transitions or manipulation, enhancing the reliability and fairness of the event system.

3. Reward Calculation Module:

A dedicated RewardCalculator module computes rewards based on clearly defined criteria provided by the game design team for this event. Factors include quest difficulty levels, completion speed, or specific player achievements.

Reward tiers are clearly defined within the module, aligning with the rarity and exclusivity tiers specified for the limited-edition Mythborne Companion NFTs.

The module outputs structured reward data, including NFT identifiers, rarity tiers, and metadata, ready for subsequent processing by the NFT minting handler.

4. NFT Minting and Distribution Handler Interface:

While actual blockchain minting is not yet implemented, a placeholder NFTMintHandler interface has been created. It receives structured reward data from the RewardCalculator module once quest completion is verified.

This handler currently logs and queues reward distribution requests, generating unique, traceable transaction identifiers that future blockchain integration can utilize.

The placeholder handler includes callback hooks to indicate completion of the minting request submission and simulate NFT distribution feedback, maintaining clear communication with the front-end UI to inform players of the status of their NFT rewards.

Overall, this backend logic provides a clear, modular, and scalable foundation for the first NFT event, ensuring smooth progression tracking, fair reward calculation, and seamless future integration with blockchain minting functionality.
