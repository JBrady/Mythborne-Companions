Detailed NFT Implementation Specification for Mythborne Companions

1. Detailed Rarity Tiers:
To ensure clarity and player engagement, NFTs in Mythborne Companions will be structured into five distinct rarity tiers:

Common (45% of NFTs minted)

Visual: Basic companion models with standard coloration and minimal particle effects.

Gameplay: No gameplay advantage; purely aesthetic collectibles.

Uncommon (30% of NFTs minted)

Visual: Special coloration schemes, minor particle effects.

Gameplay: Minor cosmetic animations (idle animations, emotes); no gameplay stats advantage.

Rare (15% of NFTs minted)

Visual: Exclusive coloration, moderate particle and animation effects.

Gameplay: Unique companion animations and interaction emotes; no stats or gameplay advantage.

Epic (8% of NFTs minted)

Visual: High-quality models with complex particle effects and animations.

Gameplay: Exclusive emotes and interactions; special unlockable companion-themed profile borders and banners; no gameplay stats advantage.

Legendary (2% of NFTs minted)

Visual: Unique, handcrafted designs with extensive particle and visual effects.

Gameplay: Exclusive companion-themed player profile decorations, unique companion voice/sound effects; entirely aesthetic, no gameplay stats or power advantage.

Mint Limits:

Each rarity tier will initially have defined mint limits per seasonal event or collaboration:

Common: Unlimited minting within event duration.

Uncommon: Max 10,000 per event.

Rare: Max 5,000 per event.

Epic: Max 1,000 per event.

Legendary: Max 200 per event.

2. Distribution Mechanisms:
NFTs will be distributed through four primary mechanisms, each clearly defined below:

Seasonal Events:

Frequency: Quarterly events lasting approximately two weeks.

Player Actions Required: Participation in daily event quests, social interactions, and community challenges.

Probabilities: NFTs awarded based on completed milestones; guaranteed Common/Uncommon NFTs, with probabilistic Rare (10%), Epic (3%), Legendary (0.5%) drops upon reaching advanced milestones.

Lottery Draws:

Frequency: Monthly lottery events.

Player Actions Required: Players purchase lottery tickets using in-game earned currency or Pi Shards (clearly non-P2W).

Probabilities: Common (60%), Uncommon (25%), Rare (10%), Epic (4%), Legendary (1%).

Achievements:

Frequency: Ongoing, persistent in-game achievements.

Player Actions Required: Completing specific long-term milestones (e.g., collection size, social interactions, or gameplay hours).

Probabilities: Deterministic; predefined reward rarity tier per achievement complexity. Generally Common, Uncommon, and Rare tiers only.

Collaborations:

Frequency: Occasional, as per collaboration agreements (approximately quarterly).

Player Actions Required: Participation in special collaboration events or promotional activities.

Probabilities: Deterministic rewards, usually Rare, Epic, or limited Legendary NFTs depending on collaboration scale and partner agreement.

3. Pi/NFT Marketplace Interaction:
NFT Trading Mechanics using Pi Network Integration:

NFTs CAN be directly listed and purchased in the peer-to-peer marketplace using Pi Tokens:

Players must authorize their Pi Wallet connection to list or purchase NFTs.

Marketplace Flow:

Seller chooses NFT to list and sets a Pi price.

Seller confirms listing and authorizes Pi Wallet signature.

Buyer browses marketplace, selects NFT, and initiates purchase.

Buyer confirms purchase amount in Pi Tokens and authorizes Pi Wallet transaction.

Pi Tokens are transferred securely between buyer and seller wallets.

NFT transferred from seller's to buyer's inventory automatically upon successful Pi Token transaction confirmation.

Platform Fees and Rules:

A fixed platform transaction fee of 5% Pi Token value per NFT marketplace transaction.

All transaction fees transparently displayed and deducted automatically upon transaction completion.

Marketplace adheres strictly to Pi Network's guidelines and policies, ensuring regulatory compliance and transparency.

Alternative Trading Method (Pi Shards):

Players who prefer not to transact directly in Pi Tokens can use Pi Shards (in-game currency earned via gameplay or non-monetary activities).

Pi Shards are exchangeable for Pi Tokens through a controlled in-game exchange, maintaining transparency and compliance.

This detailed NFT specification provides critical clarity on rarity tiers, distribution mechanisms, and Pi/NFT marketplace interactions, ensuring alignment with the existing Pi and NFT integration concepts, Project Manager feedback, and Pi Network's compliance standards.
