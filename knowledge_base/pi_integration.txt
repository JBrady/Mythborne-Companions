Task 2: Specify Pi Token Integrations
Agent: Senior Game Designer (Collectible Creature & Social Sims)
Output: Mythborne Companions - Pi Network Token Integration Specification
Overview: Pi tokens will be ethically and compliantly integrated into Mythborne Companions gameplay loops following Pi Network's Technical Guidelines and Platform Policies. These integrations will strictly avoid scenarios resembling gambling, pay-to-win mechanics, or speculative investment activities. Pi Network explicitly prohibits direct Pi mining within apps; thus, players cannot directly earn Pi tokens through gameplay. Instead, players will earn the in-game resource "Pi Shards," convertible into Pi tokens through authorized marketplace transactions, adhering strictly to Pi Network policies.


Pi Token Integration Details:
I. Pi Token Earning Mechanics (Policy-Compliant Constraints):
As per Pi Network guidelines, direct earning of Pi tokens through gameplay actions is strictly prohibited. Players will not directly earn Pi tokens by playing Mythborne Companions.
Instead, players earn "Pi Shards," an in-game resource through active gameplay (exploration, battling, crafting, social interactions). Pi Shards serve as an intermediate resource entirely within the game ecosystem.
Players can securely trade Pi Shards via the integrated Pi marketplace for Pi tokens with other players, thus indirectly earning Pi by exchanging their earned in-game resource with others. This peer-to-peer marketplace transaction aligns with Pi Network's compliant and ethical integration policies.
Example Pi Shard Earning Rates (Indicative):

Exploration Missions: 10-25 Pi Shards per completed mission.
PvE Battles: 5-15 Pi Shards per successful battle.
Special Weekly Events: 50-100 Pi Shards upon event completion.
Crafting Special Recipes: 10-30 Pi Shards per completed special crafting task.


II. Pi Token Spending Mechanics (Policy-Compliant & Ethical):Players will have clear, meaningful, and compliant opportunities to spend Pi tokens within Mythborne Companions, facilitating a healthy token economy while adhering strictly to Pi Network guidelines:
Cosmetic Customizations:
Unique companion skins: 0.5-2 Pi each
Exclusive home base decorations: 0.2-1 Pi each
Mythkeeper Avatar outfits & accessories: 0.5-1.5 Pi each
(These cosmetic items are strictly visual without gameplay advantages, ensuring ethical compliance.)

Gameplay Convenience & Quality-of-Life Enhancements (Balanced & Ethical):
Speeding up crafting timers: 0.1-0.5 Pi per acceleration (capped usage per day to maintain fairness)
Expanding companion storage space: 1-3 Pi per additional slot
Instant companion egg hatching (purely time-based convenience): 0.2-0.8 Pi per egg
Special Crafting & Exclusive Recipes (Non-Pay-to-Win):
Exclusive cosmetic crafting blueprints: 1-2 Pi each
Limited-time special crafting recipes (cosmetic or convenience-only): 0.5-1.5 Pi each


III. Marketplace Integration for Pi Transactions (Strictly Compliant):
Players utilize a secure, integrated Pi-compatible marketplace platform that adheres to Pi Network policies, facilitating peer-to-peer trades where players exchange Pi tokens for in-game items, Pi Shards, and collectibles.
All marketplace transactions comply with Pi Network's technical guidelines, requiring explicit player-initiated Pi wallet authorization and transparent transaction tracking.
Prices set by players; marketplace provides safeguards, clear disclosures, and anti-fraud protections compliant with Pi Network guidelines.
Example Marketplace Transactions (Indicative Player-Driven Pricing):
Companion Egg (rare species): 1-5 Pi
Companion Shards (common species): bundle of 10 shards at 0.5 Pi
Rare crafting materials: bundles for 0.2-1 Pi
Pi Shards: 100 Pi Shards traded amongst players for approximately 0.5-1 Pi (indicative exchange rate)


IV. Alignment with Pi Network Technical Guidelines & Policies:This integration strictly complies with Pi Network's official guidelines, including but not limited to:
NO direct Pi mining or crypto token generation through gameplay actions.
NO speculative investment, gambling mechanics, or pay-to-win scenarios.
Explicit user consent and secure authorization before all Pi token transactions.
Complete transparency regarding Pi token usage, pricing, and transactions.
Regular communication and coordination with Pi Network authorities to ensure ongoing compliance and policy alignment.


By implementing these integrations, Mythborne Companions ensures a meaningful, ethical, player-driven Pi token economy, fully compliant with Pi Network's technical guidelines and platform policies, enhancing player experience without compromising fairness or ethical standards.End of Specification Document.
