Task 2: Lead Programmer - Implement Game-Side Event Backend Logic
Agent: Lead Software Engineer (Mobile Web Games - HTML5/JS)

Output:

The backend modules for the first NFT event have been successfully implemented as per the outlined backend logic structure and detailed NFT implementation specification. The implementation includes the following core modules:

EventQuestTracker: Manages player progress through event-specific quests, accurately tracking quest status and updates.

EventMilestoneEvaluator: Evaluates player progression milestones and determines eligibility for rewards at each defined event milestone.

NFTRewardCalculator: Implements precise logic to determine NFT reward rarity based on milestone completion probabilities. It rigorously enforces mint limits per rarity tier as outlined in the specification (e.g., Common/Uncommon unlimited, Rare max 5000, Epic max 1000, Legendary max 200).

NFTHandlerInterface: Clearly defined interface for communication with the NFT handler placeholder, ensuring correct integration points and seamless interactions for minting and reward distribution.

The implemented backend code strictly adheres to the previously agreed upon plan and the detailed NFT event specification provided by the Game Designer. Comprehensive unit tests have been included for critical logic components, ensuring stability, correctness, and maintainability. All finalized backend modules have been committed into the appropriate project directory under /backend/modules/nft_event.js.
