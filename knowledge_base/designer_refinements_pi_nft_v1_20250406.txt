Agent: UI/UX Designer (Mobile Web)

Output:

NFT Marketplace Transaction Process - Detailed User Interaction Flow (Optimized for Pi Browser)

Step-by-Step Flow Document:

1. Listing an NFT for Sale:

User navigates to "My Collection" via the main marketplace menu.

User selects an NFT they wish to sell, opening the NFT detail screen.

User taps "List for Sale" button prominently displayed beneath NFT details.

A listing screen appears, prompting the user to input:

Price in Pi (clearly indicated currency).

Optional expiration date for the listing (default is indefinite).

User confirms listing details and taps "Confirm Listing."

System shows a brief loader animation labeled "Creating Listing..."

→ Upon success: user sees a confirmation message "NFT listed successfully!" and returns automatically to "My Listings" page.

→ Upon error: user sees descriptive error message (e.g., "Listing failed—please try again.") and remains on listing screen for retry.

Wireframe Sketch:

[NFT Detail Screen: NFT visual + name/details → "List for Sale" button]

[Listing Screen: Input Price Pi | Expiration Date (Optional) → Confirm Button]

[Confirmation/Success Modal: "NFT listed successfully!" → redirect to "My Listings"]

2. Browsing Listings:

User accesses main marketplace via bottom navigation "Marketplace."

User sees a scrollable feed of NFT listings with clear thumbnails, names, prices (Pi), rarity indicators.

Users can filter/sort listings by: Price range, NFT rarity/edition, Recently listed, Seller reputation (future implementation).

Tapping a listing opens NFT detail view, showing enlarged artwork, detailed NFT metadata, seller details, and prominent "Buy Now" button.

Wireframe Sketch:

[Marketplace Browse Screen: thumbnails, NFT titles, Pi prices, rarity indicators, sorting/filter buttons]

[NFT Detail View: detailed NFT image/info, seller info, "Buy Now" prominent button]

3. Initiating a Purchase using Pi (Pi Wallet Flow):

User taps "Buy Now" on NFT detail page.

Confirmation modal appears, displaying clear purchase details: NFT name/image, seller, price clearly shown in Pi, and a prominent "Proceed to Payment" button.

User taps "Proceed to Payment," triggering the Pi Wallet integration flow:

Pi Wallet app opens automatically (via app-switch or web integration).

Pi Wallet displays transaction details (recipient, amount, memo) and prompts the user to review and explicitly authorize the transaction.

User authorizes transaction within Pi Wallet (via secure authentication step), transaction submitted securely.

Wireframe Sketch:

[Buy Confirmation Modal: NFT details, price in Pi → "Proceed to Payment"]

[Pi Wallet Authorization Screen: clearly visible recipient/payment info, "Authorize Transaction" button]

4. Confirming the Transaction:

Post-authorization, Pi Wallet sends a secure callback to the Mythborne Companion game backend indicating transaction submission/successful authorization.

Marketplace UI updates immediately with a "Transaction Submitted" modal and a loading spinner clearly labeled "Awaiting Blockchain Confirmation..."

Wireframe Sketch:

[Transaction Submitted Modal: clearly shows "Awaiting Blockchain Confirmation..." with spinner]

5. Handling Transaction Success or Failure:

Transaction processing occurs asynchronously on Pi Network blockchain.

UI provides clear visual status indicators throughout this asynchronous period: "Pending" status clearly indicated in user's transaction history.

Upon transaction confirmation success:

User receives a modal notification: "Transaction Successful! NFT is now in your collection."

NFT is securely transferred and appears in user's "My Collection."

Upon failure (transaction rejected or blockchain error):

User receives modal notification: "Transaction Failed. Your Pi balance has not been deducted. Please try again."

User returns to NFT detail page with option to retry.

Wireframe Sketch:

[Success Modal: "Transaction Successful!" → "View NFT in Collection" button]

[Failure Modal: "Transaction Failed" → "Retry" or "Cancel" buttons clearly available]

Summary of Wireframes (for ease of implementation):

NFT Detail → List NFT → Listing Input → Listing Confirmation

Marketplace Browse → NFT Detail View → Buy Confirmation Modal

Pi Wallet Authorization → Transaction Submitted Modal (Await Confirmation)

Transaction Success Modal → User Collection Update

Transaction Failure Modal → Option to Retry or Cancel

This detailed interaction flow provides clear, intuitive user journeys through NFT marketplace transactions, ensures transparent Pi Wallet authorization integration, and delivers robust handling of transaction states, fully optimized for Pi Browser and Mythborne Companions' mobile web experience.
